The first parameter for UTL_FILE.OPEN is an entry in dba_directories created...

...but you can't reference sub-directories in scripts, so these'll need there own entry...
SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY custom_data AS '/opt/oracle/oradata/custom-scripts/data';

if your user may need privilege to do this then system needs to grant this privilege...
